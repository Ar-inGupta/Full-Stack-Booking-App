# Full Stack Booking App

The Full Stack Booking App is a web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to book accommodations, add their own accommodations, and view their bookings.

## Pages

The Full Stack Booking App consists of the following pages:

- **Index Page**: Displays a list of available accommodations, including their title, price per night, and address. Clicking on a specific accommodation takes you to the detailed page for that place, showing photos, address, title, description, perks, extra information, check-in/check-out time, maximum number of guests, and a "Book This Place" button. The "Book This Place" button also displays the total price when selecting check-in and check-out dates.

- **Login Page**: Allows users to log in to their accounts.
